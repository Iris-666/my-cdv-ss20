### "Radio Lab Right to be forgotten"
This podcast reminds me of a book called “The Googlization of Everything”, in which the author argues that “For most of human history, forgetting has been the default and remembering the challenge.” (p 178) and now this has been flipped. Remembering is no longer a challenge while forgetting becomes hard. In this case of cleveland.com, I think the requests from those who suffered from old stories about minor crimes they committed sound reasonable. Sometimes these bad histories of some minor crimes don’t mean this person is still that bad now. If every single story is stored online forever, then the world would become like the book “Les Miserables”, in which Jean Valjean got 19 years' imprisonment for just stealing one bread for his starving sister. Even after he was released, he can only wonder on the street because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. From this movie, we can see that Valjean is actually a pretty nice and capable person. His life was ruined just because he steals one bread for his sister who was almost starving to death. It’s reasonable to punish him, but I don’t think 19 years’ imprisonment and a passport that marks him as a convict, which will go with him for a lifetime are reasonable.

I guess this is one of the reasons that a lot of news just use aliases for those who are mentioned. I think it’s a very good solution to this problem since actually the name of the people in the news or articles are not really important. Except for some serious and violent crimes, it’s not necessary to include the real name of people who commit other minor and non-violent crimes. The alias can help to avoid this kind of issue well.

### "The Daily The End of Privacy as we know it?"
First of all, I want to say that this podcast is quite gripping and the form of storytelling makes me feel like reading a detective novel book. I feel surprised that this Clearview AI app is being used by the federal government already. It makes me feel quite ambivalent. On one hand, Clearview AI is made by scraping the data from the websites. It’s not illegal to scrape the websites and we just learned how to do that. Also, it’s very effective in helping to solve some cases. However, Clearview AI is doing something really frightening. They can monitor who law enforcement is looking for and even manipulate the results.

I think using this system only for law enforcement as Hoan Ton-That said in the interview is totally fine and very useful. However, nobody knows who can get access to this system since it is not overseen by anyone other than the Clearview AI company. The technology itself is neither right or wrong. Web scraping and facial recognition are extensively used in our life. However, a combination of these two technologies can create such a helpful as well as a dangerous tool.

Therefore, I think one solution would only allow the federal government to control and use this kind of system. However, it would still be a problem since web scraping and facial recognition are accessible to anyone, which means anyone can have the chance to build such a system by themselves.
