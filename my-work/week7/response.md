###Response to Shoshana Zuboff

Under the surveillance capitalism, these surveillance companies not only know us, track us, and monitor us, but also influence and modify our behavior in the scale of populations. It’s a one-way mirror since the surveillance knows so much about us but we know so little about them. I like this metaphor a lot since it vividly shows the asymmetric relationship between the surveillance and us, what they called the users. </br>

It’s interesting that she says this book is written for all the children and all the young people. As one member of this generation, we grew up in the digital age and under this surveillance capitalism. Therefore, we may take it for granted that it’s common to be surveilled since our life has been full of targeted advertisements when we were still children. Therefore, I quite appreciate her aim to write this book.</br>
However, I’m skeptical about whether we can really find a solution inside capitalism. She mentions that we may be able to build new information capitalism that is aligned with the true needs of populations that is for us, not just about us. A way interacting with technology that is both profitable for corporations and not based on surveillance capitalism sounds too ideal and personally, I think as long as it’s capitalism, it stands a good chance that profits and benefits overweigh the users. </br>
I think my experience of searching for datasets this weekend is quite related to this topic. Although we are in this age of surveillance capitalism and we know that our behavior and data are collected. However, It’s hard for us, the users to get these data. For example, I tried to get some datasets from some music player or video player apps, I just don’t know where I can get these data. This shows the extreme asymmetric of power and knowledge.
