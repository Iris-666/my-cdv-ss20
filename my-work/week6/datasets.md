This is a huge dataset contains 50 years of Billboard’s “Year-End Hot 100” rankings and those songs’ lyrics. I would like to specificly focus on the place names in these lyrics. I think songs are always related to some stories of the authors. If they include some certain place names, there may be some stories related to that place.
I'm also trying find some datasets that contains more Chinese songs and I can search for the place names more specificly in Shanghai. </br>
With this kind of datasets, I would like to create a map to visualize the places that are mentioned in the lyrics and which places are mostly mentioned in the lyrics.</br></br>

This dataset contains things lost (and not yet found) on the New York subway. It's interesting to look at this list since I can find many unexpected stuff that I'm really surprised how people can forget this, for example air conditioner, guitar, baby stroller, etc. As a people who always lost things, I'm interested in discovering what other people tend to lose or forget. </br>
I'm also trying to find other datasets that are things lost on Shnaghai subway or other places, but I can't find a completed dateset. I can only find some lost and found websites. </br>
With this dataset, I think I can build a project that shows what things are most probably being lost, on which metro line things are lost mostly, and some unexpected things that are lost.</br></br>

This dataset includes the name, gender, age, breed, and borough of the dogs in New York City. Based on this dataset, we can explore the most popular names and breeds among the dogs in NYC. Also, we can find the sex ratio and age distribution of the dogs to see if the dogs have the issue of gender imbalance or population aging.
